# Privana

**Private, Global, Secure Communication**

Privana is a next-generation messaging platform focused on privacy and security. With robust end-to-end encryption, Privana ensures that all messages remain private, protecting your personal information from unauthorized access. Initially designed as a fully encrypted platform, Privana will later expand to include hybrid compliance options to meet the data regulations of various countries, all while maintaining a core commitment to user privacy.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2E):** All messages are encrypted on the sender's device and only decrypted on the recipient's device, ensuring that no intermediaries can access the content.

- **Privacy-First Design:** Messages are not stored on servers after delivery, and minimal metadata is kept.

- **Global Reach:** Designed to be adaptable for users across different regions, with future compliance options for country-specific data requirements.

- **Self-Destructing Messages:** Users can choose to set messages to disappear after being read or after a specified time.

- **User-Controlled Privacy Settings:** Customizable settings allow users to control what data is stored and adjust privacy settings based on location.
